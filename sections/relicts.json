Yet any witcher who thinks their diminutive stature means they present no danger commits a grave error \u2013 the kind that can end his career permanently. These denizens of dark and ancient woods are some of the most dangerous monsters known to man.\n\nLegends often mistake chorts for sylvans, ascribing to them the ability to speak, stand on two legs, gobble up cabbage, play pranks and work mischief around the household. The arrival of a true chort in a region soon puts an end to such tales. The creatures do not speak, at best communicating with each other through grunts, snorts and moans. They get about on four legs and as for their \"mischief\"... they destroy farmsteads, devouring anything that can be devoured, including cabbage, if such is available, but also extending to poultry, pork, the family dog and then the family itself.\n\nChorts fight with little finesse, running straight towards their opponent and trying to knock him to the ground with the force of their charge. After downing their foe they bite, kick and strike with their claw-tipped paws. Due to their size and four-legged posture, they are mostly unperturbed by the force of the Aard Sign, and the regenerative powers of their body allow any wounds they receive to heal at a rapid pace.",

They wield powerful magic, but one different from that of mages. They draw power from water and earth and are bound to the land in which they live. The Crones can hear everything that happens in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives and bring blessings as well as curses.\n\nThe Crones seem for all intents and purposes to be immortal. Magic elixirs keep them from aging and allow them to take the appearance of young women. These elixirs and their mystical ties to the swamps in which they live also give them supernatural strength and vitality.",

It used primeval magic to control tree roots, which would shoot from the ground on its command, dealing significant damage to any in their way.\n\nIt was resistant to the Aard Sign, but vulnerable to burning.

At times, however, a shaelmaar will dig its way to the surface and devour any men within its reach. Some shaelmaars also burrow tunnels close to the surface, collapsing buildings and causing tremors in the process.\n\nSince shaelmaars are blind, they find their way by sensing vibrations and listening for sounds. Thus the best tactic when fighting such a monster is to hurl something heavy or noisy against a nearby boulder or wall. Then pray silently that the beast will roll towards the sound and knock itself out upon striking into the obstacle.\n\nClumsy shaelmaars might seem easy targets to hit, but when even your strongest blows bounce off the thick armor plating their backs, you realize they've little need to dodge. When threatened, a shaelmaar will curl up in a ball and roll forward with tremendous impetus, becoming an unstoppable force crushing everything in its path.\n\nA witcher's best bet is to stay out of a charging shaelmaar's way and strike after its charge fails, revealing its vulnerable underbelly.\n\nA witcher of particular cunning and agility will use the Aard Sign or a bomb (Samum works particularly well for this purpose) to cause the shaelmaar to slam into an obstacle at full speed, significantly lowering its fighting ability and opening the witcher's path to victory.

Their appetite is such that they can devour more flesh than an army at a wedding.\n\nEach spriggan has mastery over plants and is inextricably tied to them. Thus if someone destroys greenery in its domain, it immediately comes to punish the disturber.",

The Caretaker had been forced into servitude by magic. Its tasks - to care for the house and protect it from intruders.

Noting these symptoms, Geralt was at first unsure what sort of a beast he could be dealing with, knowing only that he needed to be very, very careful.\n\nOnly after he carefully examined the monster's tracks did he realize it had to be an aged female shaelmaar.\n\nThe monster destroying Tufo turned out to be an old shaelmaar matriarch. Geralt hunted it down and fought it deep under the ground.\n\nThough blind like all members of its species, this creature could easily maneuver by sensing vibrations and noises. As long as Geralt stood quiet and motionless, he was safe. Yet if he took one step or breathed a bit too loud, the matriarch would start moving in his direction with great speed.\n\nGeralt had a very difficult time taking out this monster, whose armor could not be pierced by any of his weapons.

Leshens are mean, self-serving creatures - and the ancient one living in the woods near Fayrlund was surely no exception.\n\nGeralt knew freeing the villagers from their supposed protector's grasp would be no easy task - if he decided to even try. The leshen known as the Woodland Spirit was so powerful as to have mastered the art of marking. This meant the monster had inserted his essence into one of the residents of Fayrlund. As long as this unfortunate soul remained alive and near the settlement, the leshen would always be reborn near its lair.\n\nYet even with the marked one eliminated, killing the leshen would be no easy task. The monster commanded the obedience of the denizens of the woods - it could thus call on wolves, ravens or even the trees themselves for help. Luckily, it had a weakness as well: it was vulnerable to fire, that born of the Igni Sign in particular.",
